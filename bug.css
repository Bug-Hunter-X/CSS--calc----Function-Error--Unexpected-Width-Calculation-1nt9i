The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the `calc()` function is used incorrectly, leading to unexpected results. The problem lies in the usage of the `calc()` function within the `width` property of the `.container` class.  The expression `calc(100% - 10px)` is intended to make the container's width 100% of its parent's width minus 10 pixels. However, if the parent element doesn't have a defined width, the `100%` value in the `calc()` function becomes invalid, rendering the calculation incorrect.

```css
.container {
  width: calc(100% - 10px);
  background-color: lightblue;
  padding: 10px;
}
```
